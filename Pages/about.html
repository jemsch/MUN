      <h2>Learn About the Team!</h2>
    </div>
    <p>The Design Tech High School Model United Nations Team is the competitive aspect of the International Studies:
      Debate & Diplomacy class. More info about the class can be found <a href="about/isdnd.html">here</a>. </p>
      <p>In Model United Nations, we travel to three to four conferences around California to represent a country in a simulated session of a United Nations Committee.
    In these committees, we discuss one to two real-world issues with 
      the ultimate goal of passing related resolutions. In preparation for these conferences, members write papers 
      ranging from one to ten pages, conduct rigorous research on both their country and topic(s), and practice their 
      public speaking skills. </p>
      <p>Participation in Model United Nations enhances understanding of current world issues and the role of the UN and other international bodies in world affairs. It allows students to improve their critical thinking and problem solving skills, public speaking skills, writing and research skills, and more. See testimonials from alumni of the d.tech Model UN team <a href="#">here</a>!</p>
<p>The team consists of students of all grade levels dedicated to learning about the world and improving their skills. 
  Students take a greater role in the workings of the team by applying for executive and leadership positions. See our current
Executive and Leadership Board members <a href="about/leadership.html">here</a>. </p>
